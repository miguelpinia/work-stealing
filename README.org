* Work-stealing algorithms

  Algorithms implemented

  - Chase-Lev work-stealing algorithm (following the specification as described
    in the article "Fence-Free Work Stealing on Bounded TSO Processors" of
    Morrison and Afek).
  - Cilk THE work-stealing algorithm (following the specification as described
    in the article "Fence-Free Work Stealing on Bounded TSO Processors" of
    Morrison and Afek).
  - Idempotent FIFO
  - Idempotent LIFO
  - Idempotent DEQUE
  - Work-Stealing with Multiplicity
  - Bounded work-stealing with multiplicity

   - [ ] Implementation of Work-stealing with multiplicity algorithm (based on
     larger arrays).
   - [ ] Implementation of work-stealing with multiplicity algorithm (based on
     lists of arrays).
   - [ ] Implementation of bounded work-stealing with multiplicity algorithm
     (based on larger arrays).
   - [ ] Implementation of bounded work-stealing with multiplicity algorithm

** Another things to do

   - [ ] Code factorization to provide more modularity
   - [ ] Remove memory leaks
   - [ ] Write notes about the following topics
     - Test-driven development
     - Memory model in c++. As well, describe atomic and mutex operations
       available in c++20.
     - Memory fences in detail.
     - Applications of work-stealing.
     - Applications of queues.

* Memory used

  Graph of 1,000,000 vertices and 64 threads

  - Vertex :: bool (1 byte), int (4 byte), neighbours_ (24 bytes * number of
    neighbours), children (24 bytes * number of children), the previous two are
    at least 24 bytes. In total, at least 32 bytes including padding.
  - Graph size :: torus2D, each vertex has 4 neighbours, with one million of
    vertices, it should be 8 bytes of payload plus 24 * 4 = 96 bytes of
    neighbours plus 24 bytes of pointer to children, in total 128 bytes *
    1,000,000, at least in total 128 megabytes, never less than that value.
  - Colors, 1,000,000 * 4 bytes = 4 megabytes
  - parents 1,000,000 * 4 bytes = 4 megabytes
  - visited 1,000,000 * 4 bytes = 4 megabytes
